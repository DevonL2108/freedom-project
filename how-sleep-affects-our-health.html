             <br>
             <ul>
        <li><u><b>If the lack of sleep continues, it can significantly impact your overall health:</b></u></li>
        <ul>
          <li>You’re likely to be prone to serious medical conditions (e.g. obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Numerous studies show that insufficient sleep increases a person’s risk of developing serious medical conditions.</li>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li><u>Obesity:</u></li>
            <ul>
              <li>People who sleeps less than six hours per night on a regular basis are much more likely to have excess body weight, while people who sleeps an average of eight hours per night have the lowest relative body fat.</li>
              <li>Babies who are “short sleepers” are much more likely to develop obesity later in childhood than those who sleep the recommended amount.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li><u>Diabetes:</u></li>
            <ul>
              <li>People who reported sleeping fewer than five hours per night have a greatly increased risk of having or developing type 2 diabetes.</li>
              <li>Improved sleep can positively influence blood sugar control and reduce the effects of type 2 diabetes.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li><u><b>Lack of sufficient sleep over time will lead to a shortened lifespan:</b></u></li>
        <ul>
          <li>Scientists have begun to identify the connections between insufficient sleep with diseases (getting high-quality sleep is as important to health as nutrition and exercise).</li>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li><u>Cardiovascular disease and hypertension:</u> (hypertension: abnormally high blood pressure)</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Even modestly reduced sleep can lead to an increased risk of coronary artery calcification, a predictor of future myocardial infarction (heart attack) and death due to heart disease.</li>
              <li>Sleep loss can be caused by obstructive sleep apnea and an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (hypertension, stroke, coronary heart disease, and irregular heartbeat).</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li><u>Immune function:</u></li>
            <ul>
              <li>Sleep deprivation will lead to increased levels of many inflammatory mediators and decrease the ability to resist infection.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li><u>Common Cold:</u></li>
            <ul>
              <li>People who averaged less than seven hours of sleep a night were three times more likely to develop cold symptoms than those who get eight or more hours of sleep.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>

        <li><u><b>If you’ve had months of restricted sleep, it will take several weeks to recover from the significant sleep debt.</b></u></li>
        <ul>
          <li>Try to add on an extra hour or 2 of sleep a night (go to bed when you’re tired and allow your body to wake you up in the morning — don’t use alarm clocks).</li>
          <br>
          <li>Expect to sleep for about 10 hours the first night, the amount of time you sleep will gradually decrease to a normal level.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Don’t rely on caffeine or energy drinks to help boost your energy and concentration (this may disrupt your sleeping patterns even further in the long term).</li>

          <h2 class="blue-font">There are four stages of sleep:</h2>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li><u><b>Non-REM (NREM) sleep</b></u></li>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Stage 1</b><i> (the lightest stage of NREM)</i><b>:</b> the drowsy sleep stage that can be easily disrupted causing awakenings or arousals. The muscles within your body begin to relax and your brain activity begins to decrease.</li>
              <br>
              <li><b>Stage 2</b><i> (the first actual stage that defines NREM sleep)</i><b>:</b> awakenings or arousals do not occur as easily as in stage 1 and slow moving eye rolls discontinue. Brain waves continue to slow with specific bursts of rapid activity known as sleep spindles intermixed with sleep structures known as K complexes. (they both serve as protection for the brain from awakening from sleep). Your body temperature begins to decrease and heart rate begins to slow.</li>
              <br>
              <li><b>Stage 3</b><i> (the deep stage of NREM sleep)</i><b>:</b> the most restorative stage of sleep which consists of delta waves or slow waves. Awakenings and arousals are rare and often it is difficult to awaken someone in stage 3 sleep. Parasomnias (sleepwalking, sleep talking, and nightmares) occur during the deepest stage of sleep.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li><u><b>REM sleep (rapid eye movement)</b></u></li>
            <ul>
            <li><b>Stage 4</b><i> (known as the dreaming stage)</i><b>:</b> eye movement are rapid, moving from side to side and brain waves are more active than in stages 2 & 3 of sleep. awakening s and arousals can occur more easily in REM.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>

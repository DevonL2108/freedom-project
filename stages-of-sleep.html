      <ul>
        <li><u><b>Non-REM (NREM) sleep</b></u></li>
        <ul>
          <li><u><b>Stage 1:</b></u> the lightest stage of NREM → the drowsy sleep stage that can be easily disrupted causing awakenings or arousals. The muscles within your body begin to relax and your brain activity begins to decrease.</li>
          <br>
          <li><u><b>Stage 2:</b></u> the first actual stage that defines NREM sleep → awakenings or arousals do not occur as easily as in stage 1 and slow moving eye rolls discontinue. Brain waves continue to slow with specific bursts of rapid activity known as sleep spindles intermixed with sleep structures known as K complexes. (they both serve as protection for the brain from awakening from sleep). Your body temperature begins to decrease and heart rate begins to slow.</li>
          <br>
          <li><u><b>Stage 3:</b></u> the deep stage of NREM sleep → the most restorative stage of sleep which consists of delta waves or slow waves. Awakenings and arousals are rare and often it is difficult to awaken someone in stage 3 sleep. Parasomnias (sleepwalking, sleep talking, and nightmares) occur during the deepest stage of sleep.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li><u><b>REM sleep (rapid eye movement)</b></u></li>
        <ul>
          <li><u><b>Stage 4:</b></u> known as the dreaming stage → eye movement are rapid, moving from side to side and brain waves are more active than in stages 2 & 3 of sleep. awakening s and arousals can occur more easily in REM.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
